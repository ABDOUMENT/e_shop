# e_shop
This is a simple e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with localStorage as a lightweight database. Users can sign up as clients or entrepreneurs.
Clients can browse and order products, while entrepreneurs can add products, view client orders, and export order data as CSV. An admin panel (login: admin/admin) allows management of users, products, and all orders. The site runs fully on the frontend and requires no backend server, making it easy to host and share.
